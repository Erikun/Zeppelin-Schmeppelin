The Zeppelin project

Requires PyGame (http://www.pygame.org)

Needs PGU for gui stuff. Download http://code.google.com/p/pgu/downloads/detail?name=pgu-0.12.3.zip&can=2&q= and either install it, or copy the "pgu" and "data" directories into the game's directory.

Depends on PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil) for ship shading, but will work without it.
